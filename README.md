Lost and Found Web (Incomplete)

Overview:

Lost and Found Web is an ongoing college project designed as a platform for reporting lost items and aiding in their recovery. The website features a fully developed frontend using HTML, CSS, and partial integration with JavaScript.

Features:

- User-Friendly Reporting: An intuitive interface for reporting lost or found items.
- Search Functionality: Effortless database searches to locate missing items.
- Notification System (Future Scope): A planned feature to receive alerts when a matching item is reported.
- Anonymous Communication (Future Scope): Future development for secure and anonymous communication between the finder and the owner.

Technologies Used:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (partially implemented)

- Database: MySQL
- Authentication: Basic user authentication (to be expanded)
